I would also like to thank my supervisor Dr. Ioannis K. Marmorkos who with a lot of zeal agreed to supervise
and guide me through this thesis and helped and encouraged me to learn Mathematics and Physics. Lastly, I would
like to thank my mentor Dr. Konstantinos Goulianas who helped me discover teaching and helping others.
