This undergraduate thesis is dedicated to my parents for supporting me through all the hardships I had undergoing the completion of this work and
this undergraduate degree, my brother and sister who always made me feel I was doing something important, my friends who pushed me to understand,
doubt and develop deep ideas about science and engineering. Last but not least I want to give special thanks to my academic advisor Dr. Marmorkos
Ioannis, whom with great attitude and zeal took me under his guidance to pursuit studying Physics, Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing, fields
of science that I will never fully grasp. I want to also dedicate this work to my mentor Dr. Konstantinos Goulianas who believed in me and taught
me to help and support others. To all of you, from the bottom of my heart: Thank you!
