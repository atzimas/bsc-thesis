\section*{Guidelines for Literature Review}
The Literature Review chapter should provide a detailed review of the current literature related to your research topic. 

This is an important part of your paper, and it's usually substantial, typically around 15-20 pages or approximately 4500-6000 words. 

Here are some points you may want to consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Your review should summarize and synthesize the relevant literature on your topic.
    \item It should evaluate the sources and advise the reader on the most pertinent or relevant.
    \item It should demonstrate your familiarity with the topic and how your proposed research fits within the larger field of study.
    \item The literature review should be organized thematically, not by source. This means you should group research studies or other types of literature (reports, articles, etc.) together by common themes or points, not by the authors or the publications.
\end{itemize}
