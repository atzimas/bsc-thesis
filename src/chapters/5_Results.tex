\section*{Guidelines for Results}
The Results chapter presents your findings in detail, referring to the graphs, tables, or other means of data representation you have included. 

This chapter is typically around 10-15 pages or approximately 3000-4500 words. However, the length can vary depending on the quantity and complexity of the data to be presented.

Here are some points you may want to consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Results should be clearly and concisely presented. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.
    \item Use graphs, charts, tables, and other visual aids as needed to display your data. These should be clearly labelled, properly referenced and discussed in the text.
    \item Do not include analysis or interpretation of the results in this section. This will be done in the Discussion chapter.
    \item Make sure to present all of your relevant results, including those that do not support your hypothesis or unexpected results. 
\end{itemize}
