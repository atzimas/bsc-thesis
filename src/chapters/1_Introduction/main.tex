\chapter{Introduction}

In chapters 2 and 3 we are going to introduce the basis to understand some of the concepts
of quantum circuits, like superposition and quantum parallelism. In chapter 4 we make a
short introduction on the technologies we used to write and maintain the software used
to implement the quantum circuits. In chapters 5 and 6, the main body of the thesis,
we construct the basic pieces of the thesis, the Quantum Arithmetic and Logic Unit (QALU). In
more detail, chapter 5, implements the basic sub-units of the QALU. In the later chapter,
we piece together the QALU and test it using some of Qiskit API to run it in a real
quantum computer. Lastly, in chapter 7 we draw the conclusions and make some remarks on
future improvements of the design and architecture of the QALU.
