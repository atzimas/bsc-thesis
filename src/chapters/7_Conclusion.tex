\chapter{Conclusion}

\section*{Guidelines for Conclusion Section}
The conclusion section provides a succinct summary of your findings and implications. This is usually a shorter section, generally about 1-2 pages or around 500-1000 words in a long document such as a thesis. 

Here are some points you may want to consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Summarize the main points from the body of your paper, including the major findings, and the key arguments or discoveries. This should be done briefly and be linked back to the aim and objectives of your study.
    \item Discuss the broader impact of your results. How does your research contribute to your field of study? 
    \item Describe the limitations of your study. No study is perfect, and acknowledging the weaknesses or gaps in your research honestly could make your conclusions more persuasive.
    \item Suggest areas for future research. Are there aspects that you couldn't cover fully or ideas that would be beneficial to explore in the future?
\end{itemize}
