\section*{Guidelines for Discussion Section}
In the discussion section, you should interpret and elaborate on your results or findings, drawn from the data you have collected and the analysis performed. 

This is one of the most substantial sections of your paper, so it could span several pages (typically 4-5 pages or around 2000-3000 words in a long document such as a thesis). 

Here are some points you may want to consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relate your findings to the objectives of the study.
    \item Explain how your results relate to the expectations and to the literature cited in your Literature Review.
    \item Discuss any unexpected findings.
    \item Describe why you think certain outcomes occurred and what led you to these conclusions.
    \item Discuss the broader implications of those outcomes.
    \item You may also propose areas for further research.
\end{itemize}
