\chapter{QALU's Implementation with the Qiskit SDK}

In this chapter we will present five individual quantum circuits that perform fundamental arithmetic and logic
operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and magnitude comparisons (less, greater than or equal). We
are also going to present the Python code that implement those circuits as well as their diagrammatic representations.
