\chapter{Elements of Quantum Computing}

We mentioned in the previous chapter that computer are electronic systems that process binary information
is the form of voltages, thus these systems are governed by the macroscopic laws of 
Classical Mechanics. But as they shurnk down to the microscopic levels of the atoms,
new problems arose. By manipulating and storing information in atoms, electrons, spins
and \textit{quantum systems} in general, now the computer itself must obey the laws
of Quantum Mechanic, a notion that Richard Feynman introduced in the early '80s.
