\section{The Quantum ALU's Opcodes}

We had introduced four different Quantum circuits in the previous chapters:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a Quantum Adder-Subtractor,
    \item a Quantum Multiplier and
    \item a Quantum Comparator
\end{enumerate}
with each Quantum circuit giving us the operations of: addition, subtraction, multiplication and magnitued comparison.
We can encode these four operations using a bitstring of length $n=2$ because $log_24=2$. The mapping of each opcode with
its corresponding operation and Quantum circuit can be seen at the table below.

    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        Opcode & Operation & Quantum circuit \\
        \hline
        \verb|00| & Addition & $QAS$ (Addition mode) \\
        \verb|01| & Subtraction & $QAS$ (Subtraction mode) \\
        \verb|10| & Multiplication & $QMUL$ \\
        \verb|11| & Magnitude Comparison & $QCMP_{NKO}$ \\
    \end{tabular}
