\chapter{The Complete Quantum ALU}

By gathering the previous Quantum circuits we can create the Quantum Arithmetic Logic Unit very easily. Before
we do just that we would like to take a step back and analyse how this Unit may operate.

Just like a classical ALU, the Quantum ALU operates on some general purpose registers and on a register that stores
the status of logic operations. On top of those, the Quantum ALU, may need an \textit{operation code} or \textit{opcode}
to command it to do a specific operation. We shall analyze those opcodes further.
